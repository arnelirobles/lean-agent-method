#   bash holdout.sh --spec change-description.md --dry-run
#
# The spec is a fenced ```holdout block in the change description, binding each new test to the
# production hunk it depends on. This script holds that hunk out (reverts it), rebuilds, and
# requires the named test to fail. A test that passes with its hunk held out does not test it.
#
#   ```holdout
#   - test: Some.Tests.RedeemTests
#     breaks: src/Features/Redeem.cs "RevokedAt is not null"
#   - untested: src/Features/Endpoints.cs #1
#     why: route registration, covered by the inventory check
#   ```
#
# Why this exists. My method described this check for two weeks before I wrote it. The preflight
# script had no revert step, no change description carried a binding, and the review checklist item
# reading "was the mutation reverted and did the named tests fail" was answered yes, by a reviewer,
# on changes where nothing was reverted. The gate written to catch gates that cannot fail was one.
#
# Four choices worth copying.
#
# 1. A held-out tree that does not compile is INCONCLUSIVE, never a pass. Reverting one hunk of a
#    typed language usually breaks the build, and a tree that does not build runs no tests. Score
#    that as success and the gate is green forever over a check that never ran.
# 2. An unclaimed production hunk fails. Bind it to a test or write "untested: ... why: ...". An
#    omission becomes a written claim next to the diff instead of silence.
# 3. Anchors are line content, not line numbers, so a binding survives a rebase.
# 4. Distinct exit codes, so a caller cannot collapse them into "non-zero, whatever":
#      0 pass          held out, the test failed, restored, the test passed again
#      1 caught        a test passed with its hunk held out
#      2 unresolved    anchor matched no hunk or several, or zero tests ran
#      3 inconclusive  the held-out tree did not build, so nothing was proven
#
# Adapt the two lines marked ADAPT to your runner. Everything else is git and bash.
#
# Runs in a throwaway worktree. Never mutates the caller's tree: reverting a hunk over uncommitted
# work and restoring with git checkout is how uncommitted work gets lost.
